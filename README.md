# Setup

# Notes

## Screen grabbing
* FPS is *not* helped by a reduced resolution or graphics quality settings. This is
  a CPU-bound workload. My old Phenom II X4 can't keep up with GTA and the grabber as is.
  SOUNDS LIKE I NEED A 32 THREAD RYZEN CHIP. FOR SURE. TOTALLY JUSTIFIED.
* Update: It may have been a misbehaving Docker container running in the background.
  Needs moar testing.
